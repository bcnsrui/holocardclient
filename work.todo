Todo:
  ☐ Show revealed cards somehow
  ☐ Track them in hand?

Desired Animations:
  ☐ Damage done to card - play effect on card
  ☐ Downed card - play effect on card

Polish:
  ☐ Lui's oshi ability text in the choice with holopower usage
  ☐ Hawkeye visual effect

Later:
  ☐ Consider Exceed style hover, probably still use big card just put it closer to the actual card?
  ☐ confusion over performer highlight? Maybe have a singing icon animation instead
