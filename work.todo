Todo:
  ☐ First player indicator so you know when mulliganing
  ☐ Show added turn effects somehow
  ☐ Tooltip hover card in log
  ☐ Show revealed cards somehow
    - Track them in hand?
  ☐ Better text on some choose cards like archive from hand, or bloom from hand, stacked

Polish:
  ☐ Hawkeye visual effect - maybe some chains around the center/collab slots?

Later:
  ☐ Consider Exceed style hover, probably still use big card just put it closer to the actual card?
