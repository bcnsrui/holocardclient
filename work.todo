☐ deck loading

Todo:
  ☐ Clean up Stat counter distribution
    - Deck/life/holopower/cheer next to oshi
    - Archive next to it
    ☐ no oshi zone boundary

  ☐ Click info button on card to view attached cards

Later:
  ☐ Consider Exceed style hover, probably still use big card just put it closer to the actual card?
  ☐ confusion over performer highlight? Maybe have a singing icon animation instead
