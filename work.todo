Todo:
  ☐ Click info button on card to view attached cards
  ☐ Add a way so when searching cards the cards you can choose are indicated somehow
    ☐ Highlight? Add a checkbox button for show only selectable cards?

Later:
  ☐ Consider Exceed style hover, probably still use big card just put it closer to the actual card?
  ☐ confusion over performer highlight? Maybe have a singing icon animation instead
